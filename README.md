# WebAPIClient

This mini-project was made according to the official tutorial from the C # documentation (link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/console-webapiclient).

It creates an application that sends HTTP requests to a REST service on GitHub. The application reads the information in JSON format and converts the JSON to C # objects (deserialization).

## During the implementation of the project, it was studied how:

1) Send HTTP requests;
2) Deserialize JSON responses;
3) Configure deserialization with attributes.
